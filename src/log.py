    If the logger has not been initialized, this method will initialize the

    be directly returned. During initialization, a StreamHandler will always be
    added. If `log_file` is specified and the process rank is 0, a FileHandler

        name (str): Logger name.
        log_file (str | None): The log filename. If specified, a FileHandler
            will be added to the logger.
        log_level (int): The logger level. Note that only the process of
            rank 0 is affected, and other processes will set the level to
            "Error" thus be silent most of the time.
